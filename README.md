## ✨ Overview

**Sharpfile** is a terminal-based file manager for **Linux** 🐧 and **Windows** 🪟, built in pure C#. It provides a responsive, dynamic UI layout inspired by modern web frameworks like React — all running directly in the terminal.

This project was designed with performance, portability, and minimalism in mind.
